Motivated by the growing interest in conversational AI as a means to support inquiry-based learning, we investigate children's expectations, engagement, and evaluation of a spoken LLM interface with a shared, immersive visualization system in a formal educational context. Our system integrates a speech-capable large language model with an interactive spherical display. It enables children to ask natural-language question",
