A recurring practical issue is that standard mini-batch training can be unstable when trajectory lengths are highly heterogeneous, which in turn degrades \\emph{distribution matching} for trajectory-derived statistics. We propose \\textbf{length-aware sampling (LAS)}, a simple batching strategy that groups trajectories by length and samples batches from a single length bucket, reducing within-batch length ",
