Constructive Controversy (CC) theory suggests that humans deepen their understanding of a topic by confronting and resolving controversies. This study explores whether CC's benefits apply to LLM-based peer agents, focusing on the impact of agents' disputatious behaviors and disclosure of agents' behavior designs on the learning process. In our mixed-method study (n=144), we compare LLMs that follow detailed CC guidelines (regulated) to those guided by broader goals (unregulated) and examine the effects ",

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on many physics questions in textual form, their ability to generate long, high-quality visual explanations remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we introduce PhysicsSolutionAgent (PSA), an autonomous agent that generates physics-problem explanation videos of up to six minutes using Manim animations. To evaluate the generated videos, we design an assessment pipel",
