      "summary_en": "Background: In medical and health professions education (HPE), AI is increasingly used to assess clinical competencies, including via virtual standardized patients. However, most evaluations rely on AI-human interrater reliability and lack a measurement framework for how cases, learners, and raters jointly shape scores. This leaves robustness uncertain and can expose learners to misguidance from unvalidated systems. We address this by using AI \"simulated learners\" to stress-test and psychometrically characterize assessment pipelines before human use. Objective: Develop an open-source AI virtua",
